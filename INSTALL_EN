1.  Copy files from `linuxcnc` folder to the 
    `/home/{USER}/linuxcnc` folder.

    Tip: {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run

    

2.  Create folder `/home/{USER}/linuxcncweb` 
    and copy files from `linuxcncweb` to this folder.

    Tip: {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run

    
    
3.  Make these files executable

        /home/{USER}/linuxcncweb/websocketd
        /home/{USER}/linuxcncweb/ws/lcnc.py

    Tips:
    
        sudo chmod 744 /home/{USER}/linuxcncweb/websocketd
        sudo chmod 744 /home/{USER}/linuxcncweb/ws/lcnc.py
        
        {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.
        744 means all users can read, and only owner can edit/execute
    
    
        
4.  Run the `websocketd` like this

        sudo /home/{USER}/linuxcncweb/websocketd --port=80 --dir=/home/{USER}/linuxcncweb/ws --staticdir=/home/{USER}/linuxcnc

    Tips:
        
        {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.
        To abort program execution press `CTRL + C`.

    
    
5.  Checking web interface
    
    We need to know the IP address of the current system.
    So use this command
    
        sudo ifconfig
    
    and find in the output something like this
    
        eth1    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  
                inet addr:192.168.X.X  Bcast:192.168.X.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
                ...
                
    The 192.168.X.X it's your IP address.
    
    Open your favorite browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)
    Copy your IP into address field and press Enter.
    
    If all things is OK you will see a test web page 
    named "LinucCNC + websocketd + python".
