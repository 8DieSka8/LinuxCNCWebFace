Web face using popular web server nginx with PHP5 and websocket support.
So we need to instal and configure them..




1.  Installing nginx and PHP5
    
        > sudo apt-get install nginx php5-fpm
    
    


2.  Configuring nginx
    
    Open /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file 
    and replace whole text with

        server {
            listen 80;

            root /home/{USER}/linuxcnc;
            index index.html;

            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
            }

            location ~ \.php$ {
                fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
                try_files $fastcgi_script_name =404;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
                fastcgi_index index.php;
                include fastcgi_params;
            }
        }
        
    So replace {USER} with real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.
        
    Open /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file and make a replace
    
        user www-data;      ->      user {USER};

    where {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.

    And finally restart the service
    
        > sudo service nginx restart

    
    
    
3.  Configuring PHP5
    
    Open /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini file and make a few replaces

        ;cgi.fix_pathinfo=1         ->      cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
        post_max_size = 8M          ->      post_max_size = 200M
        upload_max_filesize = 2M    ->      upload_max_filesize = 200M
        
    Open /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf file and make a few replaces
    
        user = www-data             ->      user = {USER}
        group = www-data            ->      group = {USER}
        listen.owner = www-data     ->      listen.owner = {USER}
        listen.group = www-data     ->      listen.group = {USER}

    where {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.
    
    And finally restart the service
    
        > sudo service php5-fpm restart

    
    
    
3.  Configuring LinuxCNC
    
    If you want to use any standart user interface (like axis)
    with this web interface just open the file
    /home/{USER}/linuxcnc/configs/{CONFIG}/custom.hal
    and add these strings to the end

        loadusr halrmt
        loadusr linuxcncrsh

    If you want to disable standart user interface
    and use the only web interface open the file
    /home/{USER}/linuxcnc/configs/{CONFIG}/custom.hal
    and add this string to the end

        loadusr halrmt

    So open file
    /home/{USER}/linuxcnc/configs/{CONFIG}/{CONFIG}.ini
    and replace

        DISPLAY = axis      ->      DISPLAY = linuxcncrsh   
        
    NOTE: 
        {USER} it's real user name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.
        {CONFIG} it's real configuration name which uses by LinuxCNC to run.


        
                
4.  Placing web files into the LinuxCNC folder

    Open folder /home/{USER}/linuxcnc and copy all
    web files into it. The result will be like this:
    
        configs/
        nc_files/
        web_files/

        index.html
        jog.html

        
        
        
5.  Checking web interface
    
    We need to know the IP address of the current system.
    So use this command
    
        > sudo ifconfig
    
    and find in the output something like this
    
        eth1    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  
                inet addr:192.168.X.X  Bcast:192.168.X.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
                ...
                ...
                
    The 192.168.X.X (or something like this) it's your IP address.
    
    Open your favorite browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)
    Copy your IP into address field and press Enter.
    
    If all things is OK you will see a web page 
    with title "LinucCNCWebFace".
